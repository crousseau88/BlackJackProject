# BlackJackProject

##### Welcome to BlackJack!


## Description 
This is a basic command line application that simulates the game of blackjack. Upon running the program, a dealer will get a deck of cards, shuffle the deck of cards, and then deal cards to you the player and themselves. Once a hand is complete a winner is displayed and the game ends. If both the player and the dealer tie, it is considered a push and a message is displayed for push.



##How to Run
This is a simple command line program. You will need to run this program within an IDE or save the file from a text editor and then run from the command line on your computer. Once a winner is determined the game ends and will need to be restarted in order to play again.

## Lessons Learned 
This project was a lot of fun. Learning how enumerated objects can be used to build something like a deck of cards that can then be used for any card game application you desire was really eye opening to the possibilities of object oriented programming. This one really taught me a lesson in writing clean code as well. Majority of my frustrations have been due to simple mistakes such as a { in the wrong spot or a ) that didn't need to be in the code block at all. I also learned that closing and terminating all of your running applications within the console is essential to application performance. I went down a rabbit hole chasing a non issue due to console lag and could have saved a lot of valuable time troubleshooting. I also learned that taking breaks is actually an essential part of writing code and ends up making you more productive in the end, even though you feel the opposite. Stepping away after not finding an error or running into a problem most likely would have saved me time instead of wasting it attempting the same failure over and over expecting a different outcome.
